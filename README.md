## Problem Statement
- __Classroom Attendance Display__ <br>
Design a small display board for displaying the number of students present during the first period. The class teacher locks the number and later others teachers can check the display for verification. Design a hardware based solution using CCTV camers that captures entry and exit of students in a class room. Additionally it should have ability to count the number of students in the class periodically.
